Title: Promoter identification, visualization and manipulation using
        large-scale 5' end (TSS) sequence data
Description: In recent years, large-scale transcriptional sequence data has
    yielded considerable insights into the nature of gene expression and regulation
    in eukaryotes. Techniques that identify the 5' end of mRNAs, most notably CAGE,
    have mapped the promoter landscape across a number of model organisms.
    Due to the variability of TSS distributions and the transcriptional noise present
    in datasets, precisely identifying the active promoter(s) for genes from these datasets
    is challenging. TSRchitect allows the user to import, analyze and annotate the putative
    promoter (the transcription start region, or TSR) from a variety of data sources,
    including tag-based methods (i.e. CAGE) as well as paired-end TSS profiling methods
    (RAMPAGE, PEAT). TSRchitect also enables the user to visualize the landscape of TSSs,
    including the annotated promoter (TSR) for a specific gene of interest.
