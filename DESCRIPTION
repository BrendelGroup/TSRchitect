Title: Promoter identification from large-scale TSS profiling data
Description: In recent years, large-scale transcriptional sequence data
        has yielded considerable insights into the nature of gene
        expression and regulation in eukaryotes. Techniques that
        identify the 5' end of mRNAs, most notably CAGE, have mapped
        the promoter landscape across a number of model organisms. Due
        to the variability of TSS distributions and the transcriptional
        noise present in datasets, precisely identifying the active
        promoter(s) for genes from these datasets is not
        straightforward. TSRchitect allows the user to efficiently
        identify the putative promoter (the transcription start region,
        or TSR) from a variety of TSS profiling data types, including
        both single-end (e.g. CAGE) as well as paired-end (RAMPAGE,
        PEAT). Along with the coordiantes of identified TSRs,
        TSRchitect also calculates the width, abundance and Shape
        Index, and handles biological replicates for expression
        profiling. Finally, TSRchitect imports annotation files,
        allowing the user to associate identified promoters with genes
        and other genomic features. Three detailed examples of
        TSRchitect's utility are provided in the User's Guide, included
        with this package.
